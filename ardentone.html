        Every hero has a beginning. The person they were before they started their quest. Your background helps you tell
        this story and helps you define the humble start to your quest. Who were you adventurer? Before you picked up
        the sword. Before you casted your first spell. Who were you?

          <h3>Feature: Way with Words</h3>
          <p>
            The way you talk really connects with people. Whether it be
            large crowds or individuals, when you start talking, people
            are more willing to listen to you and come to your aid. If you
            provide them a convincing enough reason, some may even
            take up arms to fight alongside you.

          <h3>Charming Quality</h3>

          <h2>Suggested Characteristics</h2>
          <p>A lost minded has a natural want to try and unlock the
            mystery that is their past. This may be their entire driving
            force or something they look to piece together over time. For
            some having no memories can make them paranoid, while
            others may view it as a fresh start.</p>
