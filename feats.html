            <h3 class="openingp">
                A feat is a representation of a powerful skill or
                ability that a character can utilize. Feats go
                beyond the normal abilities received from class
                features. At certain levels your class gives you
                the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using
                the optional rule, you can forgo taking the
                feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You
                can take each feat only once, unless otherwise stated in the
                feat's description. You must meet any prerequisite specified
                in a feat to take that feat and if you lose a feat's prerequisite
                you can't use the feat until you regain the prerequisite. New
                feats are presented here in alphabetical order.</h3>

                <h2>Bardic Adept</h2>
                <hr>
                <i>Prerequisite: Proficiency with a musical instrument</i>
                <p>Your skill in song, speech and magic grants you new abilities.
                    You gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You learn one cantrip of your choice from the bard spell
                        list</li>
                    <li>
                        You gain one use of the Bardic Inspiration feature from
                        the bard class. As a bonus action, you can target a
                        creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can
                        hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die,
                        which is a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the
                        creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one
                        ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The
                        creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
                        deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide
                        before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
                        Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A
                        creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a
                        time. Once this feature is used, you can't use it again until
                        you finish a short or long rest.

                    <li>
                        You can use a musical instrument you are proficient with
                        as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses
                        Charisma as its spellcasting ability.

                        You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot.
                        Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again
                        until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell
                        using any spell slots you have. The spellcasting ability for
                        this spell is the ability that met the prerequisite for this
                        feat (your choice if both met the prerequisite).</li>
                    <li>
                        When you use an ability or cast a spell that causes a
                        creature to regain hit points that has no effect or can't be
                        used on undead, it now can be used on undead.

                    <li>
                        You can use the skull of a Medium or Small creature as a
                        spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses Wisdom
                        or Charisma as its spellcasting ability.

                    You learn an ancient ritual allowing you to turn metal to
                    ironwood. You gain the following benefits:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You gain proficiency with heavy armor.</li>
                    <li>You can perform a 1-hour ritual to convert a set of metal
                        armor or a metal shield into ironwood. This conversion
                        does not change the statistics of the armor or shield.</li>

                <h2>Heavens Touched</h2>

                        abjuration or divination school of magic. You can cast
                        each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once
                        you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast
                        that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You
                        can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the
                        appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the

                        always continue to act independently. Additionally, for a
                        creature to mount or dismount you it only costs 5 feet of
                        movement, rather than half its speed.

                    <li>
                        If a creature fails its saving throw to stay mounted on top

                    <li>
                        You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without a spell slot,

                        this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell

                    <li>
                        You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for any

                    <li>
                        You can treat a shield you are wielding as a martial melee
                        weapon with the versatile property and you gain
                        proficiency with using shields as a weapon. On a hit, a
                        shield will deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or 1d10
                        bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

                        start of your next turn. When you do so, you can make an
