            <h1>Lineages</h1>

            <h3>
                When you are creating your character you have the option of choosing between the many fantastical races
                including those listed above, but that is not your only option. You also have the option of choosing a
                character lineage. If you choose a
                lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you arenâ€™t any longer. This chapter
                outlines two new
                lineage options: Contract Bound and Underdark Survivor. <br>
                When you create a character and choose a lineage in place
                of a race, use the following rules laid out in Van Richten's
                Guide to Ravenloft.</h3>

        <div id="TwoColumns">
            <div id="FirstColumn">
                <h2>Ability Score Increases</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>When determining your ability scores, you increase one of
                    those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you
                    increase three different scores by 1. You follow this rule
                    regardless of the method you use to determine the scores,
                    such as rolling or point buy.<br>
                    If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any
                    Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.</p>
                <h2> Languages</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one
                    other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for
                    the character.<br>
                    If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any
                    languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>
                <h2>Faefolk</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Feywild, a mirror image of the Material Plane, infused
                    with potent magics, a place of awe-inspiring beauty. The
                    potent magics of this plane can change a being's physiology
                    given enough time. This type of change has created the
                    Faefolk.

                        Whether you were trapped for decades or you willingly
                        entered the plane of the fey, you have gone through this
                        change and are now gifted the whimsical nature of the
                        Feywild. The Faefolk Origins table offers suggestions on how
                        your character gained their lineage.

                <h2>Faefolk Traits</h2>
                <p>
                    You have the following racial traits.<br>
                    <strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Fey.<br>
                    <strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when
                    you gain this lineage.<br>
                    <strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 35 feet.<br>
                    <strong>Ancestral Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the
                    following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing,
                    flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.<br>
                    If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain
                    proficiency in two skills of your choice.<br>
                    <strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
                    as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim
                    light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray. <br>
                    <strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws
                    against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.<br>
                    <strong>Fey Magic.</strong> You know the druidcraft cantrip and you can
                    cast the faerie fire and charm person spells with this trait.
                    Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't
                    cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You
                    can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have. <br>
                    Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
                    ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this
                    lineage).<br>
                    <strong>Whimsical Nature.</strong> Whenever you make an Intelligence
                    (Nature) or Charisma (Performance) check, you can roll a d4
                    and add the number rolled to the total ability check.
