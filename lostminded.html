                <p>
                    You are lost in this world as you have no memories of your
                    past. You have been left with nothing besides the skills that
                    are now muscle memory to you. Besides your name and
                    some fleeting thoughts, everything you once knew is gone
                    and you have no idea why.
                </p>

                    <strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Investigation, and one Intelligence,
                    Wisdom, or Charisma skill of your choice <br>
                    <strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One artisan's tool or musical instrument
                    of your choice<br>
                    <strong>Equipment:</strong> A set of common clothes, a trinket from your

                    <h3>Feature: Memory Flood</h3>
                    <p>
                        Though you are unsure why, in certain interactions you get
                        glimpses of what may have been your past. Work with your
                        DM to determine certain events or triggers that would cause
                        your memories to begin flooding back to you.

                        Although you are without your memories it does not mean
                        that you have lost everything about yourself. Some behaviors
                        and mannerisms have stuck with you, even though you can't
                        remember why. Choose your instinctual behavior or roll on

                    <p>A lost minded has a natural want to try and unlock the
                        mystery that is their past. This may be their entire driving
                        force or something they look to piece together over time. For
                        some having no memories can make them paranoid, while
                        others may view it as a fresh start.</p>
