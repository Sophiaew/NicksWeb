            <h3 class="openingp">
                When you are creating your character you have the option of choosing between the many fantastical races
                including those listed above, but that is not your only option. You also have the option of choosing a
                character lineage. If you choose a
                lineage, you might have once been a member of another race, but you arenâ€™t any longer. This chapter
                outlines two new
                lineage options: Contract Bound and Underdark Survivor. <br>
                When you create a character and choose a lineage in place
                of a race, use the following rules laid out in Van Richten's
                Guide to Ravenloft.</h3>

        <div id="TwoColumns">
            <div id="FirstColumn">
                <h2>Ability Score Increases</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>When determining your ability scores, you increase one of
                    those scores by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you
                    increase three different scores by 1. You follow this rule
                    regardless of the method you use to determine the scores,
                    such as rolling or point buy.<br>
                    If you are replacing your race with a lineage, replace any
                    Ability Score Increase you previously had with these.</p>
                <h2> Languages</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one
                    other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for
                    the character.<br>
                    If you are replacing your race with a lineage, you retain any
                    languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>
                <h2>Contract Bound</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    With the signing of an infernal contract, a contract bound is
                    reborn into their new form. Contract bound are individuals
                    who seeked audience with powerful devils or perhaps in the
                    face of a devil's wrath struck a deal. The signing away of one's
                    soul in place for power and hellish abilities.

                    <h3>Contract Bound Origins</h3>
                    <p>
                        Contract Bound are the results of encounters with devils,
                        sometimes willing, but more often not. The nature of the deal
                        struck with this fiend has altered the life of your character.
                        The Contract Bound Origins table provides suggestions for
                        how your character gained their lineage.

                <h2>Contract Bound Traits</h2>
                <p>
                    You have the following racial traits.<br>
                    <strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Fiend.<br>
                    <strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.<br>
                    <strong>Speed.</strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet. <br>
                    <strong>Ancestral Legacy.</strong> If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the
                    following elements of that race: any skill
                    proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.<br>
                    If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain
                    proficiency in two skills of your choice.<br>
                    <strong>Sight of the Devils.</strong> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. As an action,
                    you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical up to the range of your darkvision for
                    1 minute. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. <br>
                    <strong>Devil's Hide.</strong> You have resistance to either fire damage or poison damage (choose
                    when you gain this lineage). <br>
                    <strong>Soul Collector.</strong> The souls of those you slay in combat grant you benefit. When you
                    reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution
                    modifier (minimum of one). Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short
                    or long rest. <br>
                    <strong>Devil's Tongue.</strong> Whenever you make a Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion)
                    check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check. You can speak, read
                    and write Infernal.
