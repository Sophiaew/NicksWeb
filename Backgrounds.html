          <p>
            Beyond the elves commonly found across the multiverse, there are
            some subraces that are much less known. These additional elf subrace
            options include the high flying Avariel and the arctic hunter Snow
            Elves.
          </p>
          <div id="Avariel">
          <h3>Avariel</h3>
          <p>
            Avariel, also known as winged or sky elves, are a rare sight to be
            seen, but when they are seen, they embody grace. Avariels soar
            through the sky on wings. They have a long drawn history of conflict
            with dragons, which has led to their rarity as a race.
          </p>
          <h4>Avariel Traits</h4>
          <p>
            Avariel have the following traits in common, in addition to the
            traits they share with other elves. <br />
            <strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Wisdom score increases
            by 1. <br />
            <strong>Flight.</strong> You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use
            this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor. <br />
            <strong>Sharp Eyes.</strong>Whenever you make an Intelligence
            (Investigation) check, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled
            to the total ability check.<br />
            <strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read and write Auran.

        <div  id="SnowElves">
          <h3>Snow Elves</h3>
          <p>
            Snow elves as a group have found their home in the arctic. Over time
            they have evolved to adapt to the harsh cold and thrive in it. Other
            elves may see snow elves as savages or barbaric in nature, as they
            are fierce hunters and care little for the modernity of the world
            beyond them.
          </p>
          <h4>Snow Elf Traits</h4>
          <p>
            Snow elves have the following traits in common, in addition to the
            traits they share with other elves.<br />

            energy spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so
            when you finish a long rest. When you use this feature to cast
            protection from energy, it can only be used to give a creature
            resistance to cold damage.<br />
            <strong>Snow Elf Training.</strong> You have proficiency with the
            spear, shortbow, longbow and net.<br />

          <h3>Arctic Dwarves</h3>
          <p>
            Arctic dwarves much like all other dwarves are very hard workers,
            but they do their work in the harshest of conditions. Laying claim
            upon the land of icy tundras, arctic dwarves have made their
            civilization. Across years, these dwarves have changed to their
            environment, becoming smaller, stronger and smarter. Though their
            stature is small, they are a proud people and are able to back up
            their pride.
          </p>
          <h4>Arctic Dwarf Traits</h4>
          <p>

            replace all racial traits found in the Player’s Handbook, except for
            Age, Alignment, Speed, Darkvision, and Languages.

            cold damage.<br />
            <strong>Forged in the Cold.</strong> Though small, arctic dwarves
            are mighty fighters. You gain proficiency with one heavy weapon of
            your choice and while wielding this type of weapon you do not suffer
            the negative effects of wielding a heavy weapon while being a small
            creature.<br />
